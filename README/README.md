# Description

This is a CUDA C/C++ parallelization of the Nearest Planes Algorithm, using  the CUDA Toolkit version 10.0.130 and FPLLL version 5.0. If your installed version is other than the current version, the compilation console commands used both in the .sh files and the README.txt files in each directory may require additional or different flags. In this case, please add them accordingly.
